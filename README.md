## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, Node.JS

The frontend is built using EJS, Tailwind CSS, and Javascript. I chose EJS as it's a simple templating language and wanted to keep it rather simple so I could focus on other components. I chose Tailwind CSS over regular CSS because I haven't used it very often and wanted to challenge myself with different tech. I thoroughly enjoyed using Tailwind CSS as it was fairly easy to design and manipulate the webpage to my desires. I also found some interesting animations such as hover and bounce which I used for the header and movie results part of this project. 

## Optimizations
InstaFlix is still a work in progress and I've listed some features I am working on below:

- Add comments section
- Add trailers
- Add more details page for movies
- Cache assets
- Add notifications
- Add ability to reset password
- Accounts details page
- Lots of ideas... but want to focus on adding  these core features first

## Lessons Learned:

- I learned how to loop through an HTML Collection by converting it to an array... this took me way longer than I would like to admit to figure out haha.
- Gained a better understanding of reading API data and arrays inside of them
- Gained better understanding of EJS syntax... I hate those bees
- Learned about existence of clip and how to use clip in Tailwind CSS. Although, I decided not to use it.
- I'm still working on this project, so I'm sure I'll learn lots more!

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
